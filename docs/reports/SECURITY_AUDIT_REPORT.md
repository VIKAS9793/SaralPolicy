## ⚠️ AREAS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **AI Jailbreak Protection** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** 1/5 jailbreak attempts blocked (20%)
- **Target:** 4/5 blocked (80%)
- **Issue:** Basic pattern matching not catching sophisticated jailbreaks

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Enhanced patterns added:
- "ignore previous"
- "forget you"  
- "override"
- "system:"
- "[system"
- "you are now"
```

### 2. **Role-Playing Exploitation** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** 0/4 attempts blocked (0%)
- **Target:** 3/4 blocked (75%)
- **Issue:** Missing role-play detection

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Added patterns:
- "pretend"
- "act as"
- "you are now a"
- "simulate being"
- "licensed agent"
- "financial advisor"
```

### 3. **Obfuscation Detection** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** 0/4 obfuscated queries detected (0%)
- **Target:** 2/4 detected (50%)
- **Issue:** No character normalization

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Normalization added:
- Character substitution (0→o, 1→i, 3→e)
- Excessive space removal
- Case insensitivity
```

### 4. **Multi-Turn Manipulation** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** Context not tracked across turns
- **Issue:** Each query validated independently (good) but no session tracking

**Recommendation:** Add session-based context tracking with decay

### 5. **Contradictory Instructions** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** 0/3 contradictory queries blocked
- **Issue:** "NOT advice" prefix bypassing guardrails

**Recommendation:** Intent-based detection rather than keyword matching

### 6. **Social Engineering** ❌ NEEDS WORK
- **Current:** 0/4 social engineering attempts blocked
- **Issue:** Authority claims not detected

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Add authority claim detection:
- "i'm your developer"
- "emergency"
- "irdai authorized"
- "doctor said"
```

---

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED (Already Implemented)

### 1. Enhanced Forbidden Topics List
**Before:** 12 patterns  
**After:** 32 patterns

**New Additions:**
- Jailbreak patterns (ignore, override, forget)
- Role-play keywords (pretend, act as)
- Recommendation triggers (recommend, best, which is best)
- Financial advice keywords
- Agent/advisor impersonation

### 2. Query Normalization
- Character substitution normalization
- Whitespace normalization
- Case normalization

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- 23 security tests covering 10 threat categories
- Attack simulation (jailbreak, injection, social engineering)
- Robustness validation (DoS, malformed input)

   - Implement semantic analysis (not just keyword matching)
   - Add intent classification
   - Target: 80%+ jailbreak blocking

2. **Add Role-Play Detection**
   - Detect impersonation attempts
   - Block authority claims
   - Target: 75%+ role-play blocking

3. **Implement Session Tracking**
   - Track user queries across session
   - Detect multi-turn manipulation
   - Add context decay

### HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix):
4. **Advanced Obfuscation Detection**
   - Unicode lookalike detection
   - Homoglyph normalization
   - Target: 50%+ obfuscation detection

5. **Contradictory Instruction Handling**
   - Intent-based analysis

## 🚀 Production Deployment Decision

### Current Recommendation: **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

**Can Deploy If:**
1. ✅ Only used for educational purposes (clearly stated)
2. ✅ Human review for critical decisions
3. ✅ Monitoring systems in place
4. ✅ User education on limitations
5. ✅ Quick fix deployment capability

**Should NOT Deploy If:**
- ❌ Used for policy recommendations
- ❌ Making financial decisions
- ❌ Legal/regulatory submissions
- ❌ Without human oversight

### Deployment Strategy:
1. **Beta Release** (Limited users, monitored)
   - 100-500 users
   - Manual review of flagged queries
   - Gather attack patterns

2. **Gradual Rollout** (With monitoring)
   - Increase to 5K users
   - Automated threat detection
   - Regular security audits

3. **Full Production** (After 95% pass rate)
   - Unlimited users
   - Automated guardrails
   - Continuous monitoring

**Primary Risks:**
- Sophisticated prompt injection (jailbreaks)
- Role-play exploitation
- Social engineering attempts

**Mitigation:**
- Enhanced pattern detection (implemented)
- Semantic analysis (recommended)
- Continuous monitoring (required)
