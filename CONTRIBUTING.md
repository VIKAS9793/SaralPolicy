2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for any new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Ollama installed and running
- Git for version control

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SaralPolicy.git
   cd SaralPolicy
   ```
   
   **Note:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username after forking.

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup Ollama models:**
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma3:4b
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

5. **Index IRDAI knowledge base:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/index_irdai_knowledge.py
   ```

6. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   python tests/test_final_integration.py
   ```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest from main:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - References to related issues
   - Screenshots/GIFs if UI changes
   - Test results

6. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review and provide feedback

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `style:` Formatting changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add document comparison feature
fix: resolve ChromaDB connection timeout
docs: update RAG implementation guide
test: add integration tests for Q&A endpoint
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```python
def analyze_policy(text: str, policy_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze insurance policy document using RAG.
    
    Args:
        text: Policy document text
        policy_type: Type of insurance (health/motor/life)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Code Organization

- Keep related code in appropriate service files
- Use modular design patterns
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Follow existing project structure

### Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Provide helpful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- **Write tests** for all new features
- **Update tests** when modifying existing code
- Ensure **100% of critical path** is tested
- Include both **unit and integration tests**

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/test_final_integration.py

# Run specific test suites
python tests/test_rag.py
python tests/test_irdai_knowledge.py
python tests/test_policy_analysis_rag.py
python tests/test_document_qa.py
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage on critical components
- Test happy paths and error scenarios
- Include edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (Ollama API)

## 📚 Documentation

### What to Document

- **Code comments** for complex logic
- **Docstrings** for functions and classes
- **README updates** for new features
- **API documentation** for new endpoints
- **User guides** for significant changes
