IRDAI Master Circular on Protection of Policyholders' Interests, 2024 (Dated September 05, 2024)

Key Reforms and Mandates for Policyholder Protection:

1. Free Look Period:
   - The free look period for reviewing policy terms and conditions is extended to 30 days.
   - This applies to all Life and Health insurance policies with a term of one year or more.
   - If the policyholder disagrees with the terms, they can return the policy within this period for a refund (subject to deduction of proportionate risk premium).

2. Claim Settlement Timelines & Penalties:
   - Death Claims (No Investigation): Must be settled within 15 days of receiving all documents.
   - Death Claims (Investigation Required): Must be settled within 45 days.
   - General/Health Claims: Must be settled within specified timelines (generally 30 days).
   - Penalties: If an insurer delays settlement beyond these timelines, they are liable to pay interest at the Bank Rate + 2% from the date of claim intimation/submission.

3. Cashless Authorization (Health Insurance):
   - Insurers must grant final authorization for discharge within 3 hours receiving the request from the hospital.
   - Any delay beyond 3 hours resulting in additional hospital charges must be borne by the insurer, not the policyholder.
   - In case of policyholder's death during treatment, insurers must process the claim immediately to release mortal remains.

4. Customer Information Sheet (CIS):
   - A standardized Customer Information Sheet (CIS) is mandatory for Life, General, and Health insurance.
   - It effectively summarizes policy features, benefits, exclusions, and claim procedures.
   - Must be made available in regional languages upon request.

5. Electronic Policy Issuance:
   - All policies shall be issued in electronic form (e-Insurance Account/DigiLocker) by default.
   - Physical policy documents will be provided only on specific request by the policyholder.

6. No Hidden Exclusions:
   - Insurers must explicitly state all exclusions.
   - Claims cannot be rejected based on "unstated exclusions" or ambiguous terms.
   - Font size for policy documents must be minimum size 11 for readability.

7. Ombudsman:
   - Details of the Insurance Ombudsman must be prominently provided in the policy document for grievance redressal.

8. Distribution Channels:
   - Insurers must provide a verification tool on their website for customers to verify authorized agents and intermediaries.
