B) Endowment Plans
- Combines insurance + savings
- Provides death benefit and maturity benefit
- Higher premiums than term insurance
- Returns lower than pure investment products

C) Whole Life Insurance
- Coverage for entire lifetime (typically up to 100 years)
- Provides death benefit whenever death occurs
- Higher premiums than term insurance

D) Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)
- Insurance + investment component
